# roman-numerals-kata

This Kata is intended to convert integers/normal numbers to roman numerals, The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)

Example:

     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII

- One thing in these romans never discovered in these numbers  the number zero.
- There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3999. (The Romans themselves didn’t tend to go any higher)
